        <h1 class = "steps-title">How to do</h1>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Slicing Onions: </strong> Start by slicing one of the onion quarters as thin as you can—this is important so you don’t end up with big bites of onion later. Set it aside for serving the soup.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Start Your <em>(Easy!)</em> Broth: </strong> In a large pot, combine the remaining 3 onion quarters, beef broth, chicken broth, water, fish sauce, ginger, cinnamon, sugar, star anise, and cloves. Bring everything to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer for 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Prepare Noodles: </strong> Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Off the heat, add the noodles and let them sit, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until they’re soft and pliable but not quite tender—5 to 10 minutes. Drain and rinse well with cold water, then set aside.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Begin <em>Brothing</em>: </strong> Over a large bowl, strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer, discarding the solids, and pour the clear broth back into the pot. (Or if you have a fine mesh spider, you can use that to fish out the solids—it’s much easier!) At this point, the broth can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Bring the strained broth to a boil and add the soaked noodles. Cook them until they’re just tender, no more than a minute—you don’t want them to lose their “chew.”
                </li>
                <li><strong>Top It Off: </strong> Using tongs (or a spider, if you have one), lift the noodles from the pot and divide them evenly into serving bowls. Reduce the heat to a simmer and add the sliced beef to the broth. Let it simmer just until it’s no longer pink, about 1 minute—be careful not to overcook the beef, or it can become tough! Using a slotted spoon or spider, remove the beef from the broth and divide it between the bowls. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and beef, then top each bowl with the reserved thinly sliced onions, bean sprouts, and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges, hoisin, and sriracha on the side. This recipe makes two large dinner-sized bowls or four smaller ones.
