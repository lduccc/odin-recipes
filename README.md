This is my first ever project in The Odin Project! I'm making a website of recipes right now, it's fun!

It took me around 30-40 minutes as well, so pretty fast considering I have to debug a lot because I kinda over complicated things sometimes...

Overall, It's a nice project! Feeling pretty good about myself.
